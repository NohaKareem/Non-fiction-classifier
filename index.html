  <title>Non-fiction Classifier</title>

<body>
  <h1>Judging a (non-fiction) book by its cover</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    This is a classifier that classifies non-fiction book covers, using <a
      href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a>. This is built to test how reliably a
    learning algorithm could detect a non-fiction book category by its cover.

      <p>A total of 315 images were trained, across 7 categories, with 45 samples each. An 'Other' category was provided
        to categorize other non-fiction genres. It included a selection of non-fiction topics from beauty and writing to
        crafts and woodwork. Ideally, more training samples would be provided, encompassing more diversity and thus
        providing a more nuanced learning model.
        <br>
        On default settings epochs 50, batch size 16, and learning rate 0.001.
        <br>
        on those default settings, the prediction accuracy rates are above average for biography/memoirs, food&
        cookbooks and nature. All other categories seemed to have less than average accuracy when tested with a sample
        size of 7 books. The confusion matrix reflected a confusion in nature and technology& code (this makes sense as
        some books in the tech& coding training dataset showcase nature illustration such as of birds and reptiles). The
        loss per epoch (reflecting accuracy where the closer the loss value is to 0, the better) for test dataset is at
        1.5 or higher (up to 2.5) as epochs increase. Most importantly, the loss curve (or training) is indefinitely
        decreasing, while the test loss curve (also known as validation) is indefinitely increasing, suggesting a model
        underfit (<a
